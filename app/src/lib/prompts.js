- Skeptical personas need proof inside the message (a number, a customer, a mechanism) to score above 60.

For every persona and every feature, record:

- adopt_90d (0-100): the chance they are actively using it 90 days after launch. For a feature they wouldn't use day to day, the chance they actively back it: approve it, sponsor it, expect it in their reports.
- adopt_12m (0-100): the same, 12 months after launch.
Think about the gap between the two. Novelty fades (training content, anything that needs a habit). Value that compounds grows (dashboards that need history, reports that matter at renewal). Setup effort and change fatigue slow early adoption. Distrust (cameras, data about workers) caps both.
